# Realtime Emotion Guessing of Autonomous Vehicle Passengers Supported By The Circumplex Model

### Keywords: Autonomous driving, User experience, Emotion recognition, Supervised Learning, Computer Vision, Data Set Comparison
### Abstract: 
As autonomous vehicle technology revolutionizes transportation, ensuring passenger comfort and safety remains paramount. In this paper, we propose a predictive facial emotion guessing model tailored for users of an autonomous vehicle bus-shuttle. Using a small-scaled model architecture, we train a custom model enabled by multi-task learning to estimate discrete emotions and the values of the continuous circumplex model - valence and arousal. Within the scope of our research, our proposed architecture is applied on the two common datasets AffectNet and EMOTIC, in search for a more suitable approach.

### Tasks of this project:

[1] Implement live video emotion guessing discrete

[2] Extent code to guess the continuous values of the circumplex model of affect

[3] Test model performance on AffectNet and EMOTIC

[3] Adapt live code to recognize emotions from multiple faces at the same time and the seat they are sitting in (Seat 1, 2 or 3)

[4] Live test emotion recognition on persons watching a video

[5] Research methods for validating and improving results for future work
