# Theme: Real Time Emotion Recognition in Passengers of Autonomous Vehicles

### Method: Supervised Learning, Computer Vision 
### Topic: 
Live recorded videos can be used to label sensor data after recorded events. However, using recorded videos poses significant challenges concerning data privacy protection. This project aims to design a system where sensor data is labeled automated and in real-time without the need to save recorded videos, thereby enabling the collection of sensor data from passengers of autonomous vehicles without infringing upon their right to data privacy.
### Tasks of this project:
[1] Implement live video emotion recognition based on tutorial (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-emotion-recognition-from-facial-expressions-using-python-64e58d4324ff)
[2] Adapt code to recognize emotions from multiple faces at the same time and the seat they are sitting in (Seat 1, 2 or 3)
[3] Send timestamp, passenger seat and recognized emotion to the vehicle
[4] Live test emotion recognition on persons watching a video
[5] Research methods for validating and improving results for future work
